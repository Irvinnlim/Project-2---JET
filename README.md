## Reflection

This was a 3 week long project built during my second module at General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point.

I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull stock data from the FinnHub API based on the company there were interested in. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `React Router v6`.

One of the main challenges I ran into was mapping and rendering the different data structure between the FinnHub API and Lightweight Chart. This led me to spend a few days on researching and understanding the data structures in order to render the data visualization on the webpage.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are `React`, `React Router v6` and a significant amount of `JSX` and `CSS`. In the subsequent projects, I will begin to build on the backend setup.
